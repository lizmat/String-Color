Revision history for String-Color

{{$NEXT}}

0.0.7  2021-05-15T19:46:41+02:00
    - Added dependency to Array::Sorted::Util back: we need "inserts"
    - Reorganize %!clean2color internals.  Instead of just the color, it
      now consists of a Pair with the color as key, and a native str array
      with all the strings that share the same cleaned key.
    - Add .aliases method to return all the aliases of a string
    - Method .add now returns the strings that have been added again

0.0.6  2021-05-09T11:50:48+02:00
    - Simplify further, just use hashes
    - Rely on OO::Monitors to limit multi-thread access to hashes

0.0.5  2021-05-08T15:00:29+02:00
